# scratch-client-omg

Scratch was crashing Firefox (nightly) for a while and I needed a way to view and reply to comments. This is the code I used. Also, it's all absolutely free-as-in-freedom, unlike most of the Scratch website (of which the client is now partially, but not completely, open source).
